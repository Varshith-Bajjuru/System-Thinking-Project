              What is fuel economy and why is it important?
            </h3>
            <ul class="answer hidden">
              <li>
                Fuel economy refers to how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel,
                usually measured in miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100
                kilometers (L/100km). It is important because higher fuel
                economy means lower fuel consumption, which can save money and
                reduce environmental impact by cutting down on greenhouse gas
                emissions.

            <h3 class="Question">How is fuel economy calculated?</h3>
            <ul class="answer hidden">
              <li>
                Fuel economy is calculated by dividing the distance a vehicle
                travels by the amount of fuel consumed. For example, if a car
                travels 300 miles and uses 10 gallons of fuel, the fuel economy
                is 30 MPG (miles per gallon).

              What factors affect a vehicle’s fuel economy?
            </h3>
            <ul class="answer hidden">
              <li>
                Several factors affect fuel economy, including driving habits,
                vehicle maintenance, weather conditions, load weight,
                aerodynamics, and the type of fuel used. For example, aggressive
                driving, heavy loads, and under-inflated tires can decrease fuel
                economy.

              How can I improve my vehicle’s fuel economy?
            </h3>
            <ul class="answer hidden">
              <li>
                You can improve fuel economy by maintaining proper tire
                pressure, reducing excess weight in the vehicle, avoiding
                aggressive driving, keeping your engine properly tuned, and
                using the recommended grade of motor oil. Additionally, driving
                at moderate speeds and using cruise control on highways can
                help.

            <h3 class="Question">
              How do hybrid and electric vehicles improve fuel economy?
            </h3>
            <ul class="answer hidden">
              <li>
                Hybrid vehicles combine a gasoline engine with an electric
                motor, allowing for better fuel economy by using electric power
                at lower speeds or during idling. Electric vehicles (EVs) don't
                use gasoline at all, relying entirely on electric power, which
                can dramatically improve efficiency and reduce fuel costs.

            <h3 class="Question">
              What is the EPA’s role in fuel economy ratings?
            </h3>
            <ul class="answer hidden">
              <li>
                The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tests vehicles and
                provides official fuel economy ratings in the U.S. These ratings
                help consumers compare different vehicles' fuel efficiency. The
                tests are conducted under controlled conditions to simulate city
                and highway driving.

            <ul class="answer hidden">
              <li>
                Yes, the type of fuel can affect fuel economy. For example,
                higher-octane fuels may not necessarily improve fuel efficiency
                in engines designed for regular fuel. Ethanol-blended fuels can
                also reduce fuel economy slightly because ethanol contains less
                energy per gallon than gasoline.

              What is the difference between fuel economy and fuel efficiency?
            </h3>
            <ul class="answer hidden">
              <li>
                While often used interchangeably, fuel economy refers to how far
                a vehicle can travel on a certain amount of fuel, typically
                expressed in MPG or L/100km. Fuel efficiency, on the other hand,
                refers to how effectively the engine converts fuel into usable
                energy, and is a more technical measure of engine performance.

              What is the difference between conventional gasoline vehicles and

            </h3>
            <ul class="answer hidden">
              <li>
                Fuel-efficient vehicles are designed with technologies like
                turbocharging, direct injection, lighter materials, and improved
                aerodynamics to maximize fuel economy. In contrast, conventional
                gasoline vehicles typically don't include these advanced
                features and may have lower MPG ratings.

              Are fuel economy estimates accurate for real-world driving?
            </h3>
            <ul class="answer hidden">
              <li>
                Fuel economy estimates provided by the EPA or manufacturers are
                based on controlled tests and may not exactly reflect real-world
                driving conditions. Actual fuel economy may vary depending on
                factors such as driving habits, road conditions, weather, and
                vehicle maintenance.
