              <p>
                Renewable energy sources offer clean and abundant alternatives
                to fossil fuels. They have experienced rapid global adoption and
                capacity growth in recent years, making them a crucial

              <h3>2. Bio Fuels</h3>
              <p>
                Biofuels are derived from organic materials, such as plants and
                waste, providing a renewable alternative to petroleum-based
                fuels. They are commonly used in transportation, with ethanol
                and biodiesel being the most popular.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Within the next decade, biofuel production is set to rise by
                    30%, driven by advancements in second-generation biofuels
                    from non-food crops. These innovations will make biofuels
                    more sustainable, with a lower carbon footprint and less
                    competition with food production.

              <h3>3. Hydrogen Fuel</h3>
              <p>
                Hydrogen fuel, when used in fuel cells, produces only water,
                making it a clean energy carrier. It has significant potential
                in decarbonizing industries and transportation sectors.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    By 2034, hydrogen fuel is expected to become a mainstream
                    energy source, particularly for heavy-duty transport and
                    industrial applications. Green hydrogen, produced using
                    renewable energy, will grow in use, reducing costs and
                    promoting widespread adoption.

              <h3>4. Energy Storage Technologies</h3>
              <p>
                Energy storage technologies, such as lithium-ion batteries,
                store excess renewable energy for later use, providing stability
                to the grid and supporting electric vehicles.

                    solid-state batteries and long-duration storage systems.
                    These developments will enhance the efficiency and
                    reliability of renewable energy grids.

              <p>
                Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) involves capturing carbon
                dioxide emissions from industrial processes and storing them
                underground to prevent them from entering the atmosphere.

                    By 2034, CCS is expected to be widely adopted by industries
                    reliant on fossil fuels, helping reduce CO2 emissions and
                    slowing down climate change while allowing these industries
                    to transition toward more sustainable practices.

        <h3 class="Question"> What is fuel economy and why is it important?</h3>
          <ul class="answer hidden">
           <li>Answer: Fuel economy refers to how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, usually measured in miles per gallon (MPG) or
             liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km). It is important because higher fuel economy means lower fuel consumption,
              which can save money and reduce environmental impact by cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions.
           </li>
          </ul> 
       </div>
      <div class="FAQs-section-container" data-faq="2">
        <h3 class="Question">How is fuel economy calculated?</h3>
      <ul class="answer hidden">
        <li>Answer: Fuel economy is calculated by dividing the distance a vehicle travels by the amount of fuel consumed. For example,
           if a car travels 300 miles and uses 10 gallons of fuel, the fuel economy is 30 MPG (miles per gallon).
        </li>
      </ul>

     <div class="FAQs-section-container" data-faq="3">
      <h3 class="Question">What factors affect a vehicleâ€™s fuel economy?</h3>
        <ul class="answer hidden">
          <li>Answer: Several factors affect fuel economy, including driving habits, vehicle maintenance, weather conditions, load weight,
             aerodynamics, and the type of fuel used. For example, aggressive driving, heavy loads, and under-inflated tires can decrease fuel
              economy.</li>

     <div class="FAQs-section-container" data-faq="4">
      <h3  class="Question">How can I improve my vehicleâ€™s fuel economy?</h3>
        <ul class="answer hidden">
          <li>Answer: You can improve fuel economy by maintaining proper tire pressure, reducing excess weight in the vehicle,
             avoiding aggressive driving, keeping your engine properly tuned, and using the recommended grade of motor oil. Additionally,
              driving at moderate speeds and using cruise control on highways can help.

      <h3  class="Question">How do hybrid and electric vehicles improve fuel economy?</h3>
      <ul  class="answer hidden">
        <li>Answer: Hybrid vehicles combine a gasoline engine with an electric motor, allowing for better fuel economy by using electric
           power at lower speeds or during idling. Electric vehicles (EVs) don't use gasoline at all, relying entirely on electric power,
            which can dramatically improve efficiency and reduce fuel costs.

          <h3  class="Question" >What is the EPAâ€™s role in fuel economy ratings?</h3>
          <ul  class="answer hidden">
            <li>Answer: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tests vehicles and provides official fuel economy ratings in the U.S.
              These ratings help consumers compare different vehicles' fuel efficiency. The tests are conducted under controlled conditions 
              to simulate city and highway driving.</li>

          <h3 class="Question">Does the type of fuel I use affect fuel economy?</h3>
          <ul  class="answer hidden">
            <li>
              Answer: Yes, the type of fuel can affect fuel economy. For example, higher-octane fuels may not necessarily improve fuel 
              efficiency in engines designed for regular fuel. Ethanol-blended fuels can also reduce fuel economy slightly because ethanol 
              contains less energy per gallon than gasoline.

          <h3 class="Question">What is the difference between fuel economy and fuel efficiency?</h3>
          <ul  class="answer hidden">
            <li>
              Answer: While often used interchangeably, fuel economy refers to how far a vehicle can travel on a certain amount of fuel,
               typically expressed in MPG or L/100km. Fuel efficiency, on the other hand, refers to how effectively the engine converts fuel
               into usable energy, and is a more technical measure of engine performance.

          <ul  class="answer hidden">
            <li>
              Answer: Fuel-efficient vehicles are designed with technologies like turbocharging, direct injection, lighter materials,
               and improved aerodynamics to maximize fuel economy. In contrast, conventional gasoline vehicles typically don't include 
               these advanced features and may have lower MPG ratings.

          <ul  class="answer hidden">
            <li>Answer: Fuel economy estimates provided by the EPA or manufacturers are based on controlled tests and may not exactly 
              reflect real-world driving conditions. Actual fuel economy may vary depending on factors such as driving habits, 
              road conditions, weather, and vehicle maintenance.
