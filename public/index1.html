              <h3>1. Renewable Energy Sources</h3>
              <p>
                Renewable energy sources offer clean and abundant alternatives
                to fossil fuels. They have experienced rapid global adoption and
                capacity growth in recent years, making them a crucial
                alternative for fuel.

              <h3>2. Bio Fuels</h3>
              <p>
                Biofuels are derived from organic materials, such as plants and
                waste, providing a renewable alternative to petroleum-based
                fuels. They are commonly used in transportation, with ethanol
                and biodiesel being the most popular.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Within the next decade, biofuel production is set to rise by
                    30%, driven by advancements in second-generation biofuels
                    from non-food crops. These innovations will make biofuels
                    more sustainable, with a lower carbon footprint and less
                    competition with food production.

              <h3>3. Hydrogen Fuel</h3>
              <p>
                Hydrogen fuel, when used in fuel cells, produces only water,
                making it a clean energy carrier. It has significant potential
                in decarbonizing industries and transportation sectors.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    By 2034, hydrogen fuel is expected to become a mainstream
                    energy source, particularly for heavy-duty transport and
                    industrial applications. Green hydrogen, produced using
                    renewable energy, will grow in use, reducing costs and
                    promoting widespread adoption.

              <h3>4. Energy Storage Technologies</h3>
              <p>
                Energy storage technologies, such as lithium-ion batteries,
                store excess renewable energy for later use, providing stability
                to the grid and supporting electric vehicles.

                    In the next decade, global energy storage capacity is
                    expected to increase by 400%, with new breakthroughs in
                    solid-state batteries and long-duration storage systems.
                    These developments will enhance the efficiency and
                    reliability of renewable energy grids.

              <h3>5. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)</h3>
              <p>
                Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) involves capturing carbon
                dioxide emissions from industrial processes and storing them
                underground to prevent them from entering the atmosphere.

                    By 2034, CCS is expected to be widely adopted by industries
                    reliant on fossil fuels, helping reduce CO2 emissions and
                    slowing down climate change while allowing these industries
                    to transition toward more sustainable practices.
